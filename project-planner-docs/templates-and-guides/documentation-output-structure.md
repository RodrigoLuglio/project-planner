    │   └── ...
    └── ...
```

## Story Package Structure

Each story in the Stories folder should be implementation-ready and include:

```
Stories/EPIC-XXX/STORY-XXX-YYY/
├── STORY-XXX-YYY.md            # The comprehensive story document
├── Resources/                  # Story-specific resources
│   ├── Mockups/                # UI mockups relevant to this story
│   ├── Diagrams/               # Technical diagrams for this story
│   └── Sample_Data/            # Sample data for implementation and testing
├── Dependencies.md             # Specific dependencies for this story
└── Technical_Standards_Application.md  # How technical standards apply to this story
```

## Cross-Reference System

To maintain traceability across documents:

1. **Unique Identifiers**: All requirements, architecture components, and design elements have unique IDs
2. **Forward and Backward References**: Documents reference both what they're based on and what depends on them
3. **Versioning**: All documents include version information and change history
4. **Traceability Matrix**: A master matrix showing relationships between requirements, components, and stories

## Additional Documentation

### For Developer Agent Handoff

When preparing documentation for a Developer Agent, the following package should be generated:

```
Implementation_Package_STORY-XXX-YYY/
├── STORY-XXX-YYY.md                      # The specific story
├── Technical_Standards.md                 # The technical standards document
├── Context/                               # Contextual information
│   ├── Project_Overview.md                # Brief project overview
│   ├── Architecture_Summary.md            # Relevant architecture details
│   └── Implementation_Status.md           # Status of dependent stories
├── Resources/                             # Resources specific to this story
└── README.md                              # Implementation instructions
```

This package structure ensures the Developer Agent has everything needed in a self-contained package.
