# Story and Technical Standards Integration Guide

*This document outlines how the Story documents and Technical Standards document work together to provide complete context for implementation.*

## Integration Principles

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- **Story Documents**: Contain story-specific requirements, context, and implementation details
- **Technical Standards Document**: Contains project-wide standards, patterns, and cross-cutting concerns
- This separation allows for updates to technical standards without modifying every story

### 2. Explicit References
- Story documents should explicitly reference relevant sections of the Technical Standards document
- References should be specific (e.g., "See section 3.2 of Technical Standards for error handling requirements")
- This creates a clear connection between the two documents

### 3. Exceptions Documentation
- Any deviation from the Technical Standards must be explicitly noted in the Story document
- Exceptions must include justification and approval
- This ensures intentional rather than accidental deviations

## Package Structure for Developer Agents

When a Story is provided to a Developer Agent, it should be delivered as a complete package containing:

```
Story_Package/
├── Story_[ID].md                  # The specific story document
├── Technical_Standards.md         # The complete technical standards document
├── Story_Specific_Resources/      # Any story-specific resources (mockups, diagrams, etc.)
└── References/                    # Reference implementations or examples
```

This ensures the Developer Agent has all necessary context in one location.

## Implementation Guidelines for Developer Agents

Developer Agents should be instructed to:

1. Read the Story document completely first
2. Review referenced sections of the Technical Standards document
3. Note any specified exceptions to the standards
4. Implement according to both documents, with the Story document taking precedence in case of conflict

## Technical Standards References in Story Template

The Story Template should include a dedicated section for Technical Standards references:

```markdown
## Technical Standards Application

### Applicable Standards
- **Code Structure**: Reference Section 1.2
- **Error Handling**: Reference Section 3.1
- **Logging**: Reference Section 3.2
- **Security**: Reference Section 3.3
- **Testing**: Reference Section 5.1

### Exceptions to Standards
- **Exception**: [Description of exception]
- **Justification**: [Reason for exception]
- **Approved By**: [Approving Agent]
```

## Maintenance and Updates

### Technical Standards Updates
When the Technical Standards document is updated:
1. All stories that reference affected sections should be flagged for review
2. The Technical Standards Coordinator should review impacts on existing stories
3. Version control should maintain the version of the Technical Standards that was current when each story was created

### Story Updates
When a Story is updated:
1. References to Technical Standards should be reviewed for current accuracy
2. Any new exceptions should go through approval
3. The Story Readiness Checklist should be re-applied

## Implementation Verification

To ensure proper integration between stories and standards:

1. **Automated Checks**: 
   - Verify all Technical Standards references are to valid sections
   - Ensure all cross-cutting concerns are addressed
   - Flag potential conflicts between story requirements and standards

2. **Manual Review**:
   - Technical Standards Coordinator reviews each story for standards compliance
   - Architect reviews exceptions for technical soundness
   - Both approve before the story is finalized

## Feedback Loop

After implementation:
1. The Developer Agent should provide feedback on:
   - Clarity of the integration between documents
   - Any missing or conflicting information
   - Suggestions for improvement
   
2. This feedback should be used to improve:
   - The Story Template
   - The Technical Standards Document
   - The integration between them

## Example Integration

**Example from Technical Standards**:
```markdown
# 3.2 Logging Standards

All components must implement logging with the following requirements:
- Use the project logging framework (LogFramework v2.1)
- Log at appropriate levels (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG)
- Include contextual information (request ID, user ID if available)
- Follow the structured logging format: `[LEVEL] [TIMESTAMP] [CONTEXT] [MESSAGE]`
```

**Example from Story Document**:
```markdown
## Technical Standards Application

### Applicable Standards
- **Logging**: Reference Section 3.2

### Implementation Notes
For this story, ensure all database operations are logged at DEBUG level with 
transaction IDs included in the context.
```

This clearly shows how the general standard is applied specifically in this story.
