# Story Readiness Checklist

*This checklist is used by the Scrum Master Team to verify that each story is fully ready for implementation before it's finalized. Each item must be confirmed to ensure the story is truly self-contained and implementable.*

## Story Basics
- [ ] Story has a unique identifier following the project's ID convention
- [ ] Story title clearly describes the functionality to be implemented
- [ ] Story is assigned to the appropriate Epic
- [ ] Story size is appropriate (not too large or too small)

## Context and Dependencies
- [ ] Project overview is concise but informative
- [ ] Current state of the project (before this story) is clearly described
- [ ] Purpose of the story is explicitly stated
- [ ] All dependencies on other stories are identified
- [ ] Dependencies are correctly sequenced (dependent stories come before this one)
- [ ] Required components are listed with version information if applicable
- [ ] External services are documented with access information

## Technical Completeness
- [ ] All inputs to the component are defined
- [ ] All expected outputs are specified
- [ ] Business rules are explicitly stated
- [ ] Data models are fully defined with field types, constraints, and relationships
- [ ] File locations are specific and consistent with project structure
- [ ] Design patterns to be used are identified and explained
- [ ] Code standards are referenced from the Technical Standards document
- [ ] Framework guidelines are referenced from the Technical Standards document

## Integration Points
- [ ] All interfaces with other components are defined
- [ ] API contracts are complete with endpoints, methods, parameters, and responses
- [ ] Event handling is specified (if applicable)
- [ ] Database interactions are detailed

## Quality Requirements
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are specific, measurable, and testable
- [ ] Unit test requirements are defined
- [ ] Sample test data is provided
- [ ] Edge cases and boundary conditions are identified
- [ ] Performance requirements are specified (if applicable)

## Technical Standards Reference
- [ ] References to the specific sections of the Technical Standards document are included
- [ ] Any exceptions to the standard patterns are explicitly noted and justified
- [ ] Cross-cutting concerns (logging, error handling, security) are addressed

## Implementation Guidance
- [ ] Code examples or references are provided for complex parts
- [ ] Potential implementation challenges are identified with guidance
- [ ] Alternative approaches are discussed (if applicable)

## Completeness Verification
- [ ] Story has been reviewed by at least one other agent
- [ ] All questions or ambiguities have been resolved
- [ ] Story is sufficiently detailed that implementation can proceed without additional input

## Final Approval
- [ ] Technical Standards Coordinator has verified alignment with project standards
- [ ] Architect has confirmed technical approach is sound
- [ ] Product Owner has confirmed business requirements are met
